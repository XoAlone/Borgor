# What is this?
It is just a simple function that I made so that you can generate anime girls eating burgers and you can do whatever you want with it!


# Instructions
`npm i borgor`

# Docs
**generateBorgor()** - This is the only function in the package.

# Example
```
const borgor = require('borgor');

borgor.generateBorgor();
```
